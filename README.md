# AI-Powered-Traffic-Queue-Analysis-and-Rule-Violation-Detection-using-Video-Analytics
A technology-driven project proposal developed for the NETRIK National Hackathon with real-world application focus.
# NETRIK National Hackathon – Project Proposal

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The project addresses the growing challenge of traffic congestion and frequent rule violations at urban intersections, which are difficult to monitor manually and often lead to accidents, delays, and inefficient traffic management.
The proposed solution uses AI-powered video analytics to automatically analyze CCTV footage and detect vehicles, track their movement, and identify traffic rule violations such as signal jumping, wrong-way driving, illegal parking, and lane violations. By leveraging deep learning–based object detection and multi-object tracking, the system converts raw video streams into structured, actionable traffic insights.
The motivation behind this solution is to reduce dependence on manual monitoring, improve road safety, and enable data-driven traffic management in smart cities. Existing traffic systems often lack real-time analytics and scalability; this approach offers a cost-effective upgrade by utilizing already installed surveillance infrastructure.
The primary users of the system include traffic police departments, municipal authorities, and smart city administrators. The solution helps them by providing annotated video outputs, violation counts, traffic density metrics, and dashboard-based visualizations, leading to faster decision-making, improved enforcement efficiency, and ultimately safer and more organized roads.
